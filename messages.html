	Dear Albert,
	</br>
	</br>
	One of the best decisions I made this semester was to look over my shoulders and make conversation with the guy next to me. He wasn't dressed up as anything - just a person in a white t-shirt with Matthew Ray Chiang's face on it, dark blue jeans, and a solid dark green fuccboi cap. The conversation was short, yet somewhat substantial. As he got up to leave, he shook my hand and said, "nice meeting you, Catherine."" At that point I was wondering if I had made a new friend, but later on concluded, "nahhhhhh, just small talk."

	Fast forward 30 minutes, and somehow we ended up splitting a quesadilla at Mel's Diners. As I talked to him some more, I began wondering if he actually thought I was funny because of my drunkness or if he just laughs at everything in general. Now I know, the answer is probably both. I liked talking to him, to the point where even my own apartmentmate Amy Oklahoma Zou noticed that I was making effort to talk to a random (male) stranger.

	Hi Albert. It's been nearly two months since we met, and I assure you that it's been a great two months. 
	</br>

	The day you asked me how I would define love, I told gave you my answer without giving it too much thought. But whenever I think about it, it was actually a pretty solid answer. Going back to my definition and to the things you do for me, I can tell that you genuinely do care about me. Thanks for planning the random surprises, from dragging me out in the middle of the night to get sashimi for my birthday to delivering wintermelon creama right before my math quiz. Thanks for being my sanity check during my most stressful days even on top of your own obligations. Especially under the Berkeley environment, I think that giving someone else your time is one of the most precious thing a person can do, and you've dedicated so much of your time to me, so thank you for that.

	Ever after seeing me sick, PMS-ing, stressed, look like absolute shit, you apparently still think of me as the "cutest, funniest, and smartest" girl in your life. It's hard for me to actually take that compliment because I definitely do NOT think it's true, but I am absolutely flattered by the fact that you still think so highly of me even after seeing me so bare. 
	</br>

	Thanks for telling your kind words the other day. Knowing your reasons for liking me just made things so much more real and believable, and I have to say... I don't like myself when I'm stressed over grades and cs projects, but I do like myself when I'm happy. I like to cook you ramen, and I LOVED decking your fb chat in "HELLA GAY COLORS." I'm actually really needy, and I don't know how you've been tolerating my neediness so well. My Chinese sounds really fruity, but it's okay I guess. I like my friends too. I also like that you like me, and I just like you a lot... too.

	I do look forward to hanging out with you in Taiwan during this break. Let's just focus on enjoying this winter together. No CS projects, no midterms, no finals, and no excuses to not have fun; I will ONLY allow happy moments, good conversation, great companionship, yummy food, and maybe a lot of alcohol. Merry Christmas & Happy (early) New Year!
	</br>
	</br>
	Cheers,
	</br>
	Catherine
